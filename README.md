# UMKC HACKATHON SPRING - 2017
## Project: Online Parking Reservation System
## Team: SmartCoders
## Use Case:
In our current city parking’s, we don’t have a way to visualize the parking locations. You are supposed to work on better UI to show parking locations. For simplicity, we would have 1 parking floor. Parking can be of regular/compact type.

Primary functions: Create/Delete User Account, Reserve/ cancel reservation, Show Parking spots
